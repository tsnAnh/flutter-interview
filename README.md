# User Management App

A Flutter application for managing and viewing user data with offline support, search functionality, and modern UI/UX design.

## Overview

This app demonstrates modern Flutter development practices including:
- Clean Architecture with BLoC pattern
- Dependency Injection with GetIt
- Network API integration with Dio
- Offline data persistence with HydratedBloc
- State management with flutter_bloc
- Navigation with GoRouter
- Responsive UI with Cupertino design

## Features

- **User List View**: Browse users with pagination support
- **User Search**: Real-time search functionality with debouncing
- **User Details**: Detailed view for individual users
- **Offline Support**: App works without internet connection using cached data
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Refresh user data with swipe gesture
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry mechanisms
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators and skeleton screens
- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatic loading of more users as you scroll

### State Management

The app uses the **BLoC pattern** for state management:

- `UserListBloc`: Manages user list state, pagination, search, and API calls
- `InternetConnectionCubit`: Monitors internet connectivity
- `HydratedBloc`: Provides automatic state persistence for offline support

### Data Flow

1. **API Layer**: `UserApi` handles HTTP requests using Dio
2. **BLoC Layer**: Business logic and state management
3. **UI Layer**: Reactive widgets that rebuild based on state changes
4. **Persistence**: HydratedBloc automatically saves/restores state

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.7.2 or later
- Dart SDK 3.7.2 or later
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user_management_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate code (for models and DI)**
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Development Setup

For development with hot reload and debugging:

```bash
# Run in debug mode
flutter run --debug

# Run with specific device
flutter run -d <device-id>

# Run on web
flutter run -d chrome
```

## API Integration

The app integrates with [JSONPlaceholder](https://reqres.in/) API for user data:

- **Base URL**: `https://reqres.in/api`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /users` - Fetch paginated user list
  - Query parameters: `page`, `per_page`, `delay`

### API Response Format

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 6,
  "total": 12,
  "total_pages": 2,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "email": "george.bluth@reqres.in",
      "first_name": "George",
      "last_name": "Bluth",
      "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/1-image.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "support": {
    "url": "https://reqres.in/#support-heading",
    "text": "To keep ReqRes free, contributions towards server costs are appreciated!"
  }
}
```

## Code Generation

The project uses code generation for:

- **Freezed**: Immutable data classes and unions
- **JSON Serializable**: JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Injectable**: Dependency injection setup

Run code generation:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

Watch for changes during development:
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
